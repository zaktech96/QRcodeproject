## My process
 I first went started to work in the html adding in the relative items needed such as the image and text, also putting in the bootstrap as i used that for the initial card design.

 after that i worked on the design of the project in css starting with the main card div then, then the image then the text. After that I added twiks such as adding margin top or bottom to move the text and image around approprately to fit with align correctly.

Be more brave in pushing myself is my biggest takeaway and ask for help.

### What I learned
 one of the main takes i learnt was that in order to get bootstrap to work first i need to add the link first then my stylesheet after in order to load correctly.

I learnt alot about my self whilst working on this project and taking on projects are always better then being stuck in tutorials.

Be more brave in pushing myself is my biggest takeaway and ask for help has benefited me alot.

When publishing to nleitfy, if project is inside a folder it somehow messes things up strangely enough



### Continued development

I would like to focus more on flex and grids in future projects and work on how everything moves and in general to keep polishing up my front end technologies.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/) - This helped me for styling my card and adding my content inside it 
- [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me to undestand adding a hover and also a general practise of designing cards. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
